# Writing Guide & Tips

Starcube Labs' blog is dedicated to tips, tricks, and experiences having to do with video game development. The end goal is to be a repository of neat development processes we've all come across as we make our games! The rules are honestly pretty lax, generally any on-topic article can be posted. 

That said, here are some quick points about what should and shouldn't be on the blog:
  - Keep it Professional:
    - <i>Not to say that you need to keep it formal,</i> be as informal as you like! Just make sure you'd be okay showing it to your boss.
    - This means no NSFW content, and keeping profanity to a bare minimum, please.
  - Keep it Respectful:
    - This blog is for helping folks out! So broadly speaking, try not to bring anybody down or keep anybody out, yeah?
  - Keep it On-Topic:
    - This bears repeating, this is a blog about video game development processes. The stuff we talk about here generally leans towards being fairly practical topics. 

# Tools of the Trade

- Articles can be written by pulling down the Github Repo and adding a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file written in your Editor of choice. A fantastic example would be [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (which comes with a previewer), but if you know what you're doing you could do just fine in Notepad. 
- Alternatively you can also add and edit your Markdown files directly in the Github Editor online.
